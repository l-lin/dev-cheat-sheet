# Reverse Fizz Buzz

You must know the FizzBuzz exercise.

It's about displaying every numbers from 1 to 100, and replace:

- each number that are multiple of 3 by the String `Fizz`
- each number that are multiple of 5 by the String `Buzz`
- each number that are multiple of 3*5=15 by the String `FizzBuzz`

In this exercise, you will just have the `Buzz` String.

In the input, you will have a String containing every numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space and where:

- each `n` number will be replace by `Buzz`
- each `p` number will be replace by `Buzz`
- `n` and `p` are not multiple

You will have to find `n` and `p`.

## Input

A line of 100 words separated by a space, each word is either a number or the String `Buzz`.

## Output

A line with 2 numbers separated by a space which correspond to `n` and `p`.
