Fibonacci
=========

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers or Fibonacci sequence are the numbers in the following integer sequence:

> 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144...

Write a program that will calculate the value of the Fibonacci sequence given a number e.g. `fibonacci(6)` should return `13`.
