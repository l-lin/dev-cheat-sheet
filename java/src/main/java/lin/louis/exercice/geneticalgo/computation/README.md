============================================================================

Given the digits 0 through 9 and the operators +, -, * and /, find a sequence that will represent a given target number.
The operators will be applied sequentially from left to right as you read.

So, given the target number `23`, the sequence `6+5*4/2+1` would be one possible solution.

If `75.5` is the chosen number then `5/2+9*7-5` would be a possible solution.
