Palindrome
==========

String Palindrome
-----------------

Write a Program to check if a String is palindrome or not?

For example an String e.g. `madam` is a palindrome but `book` is not palindrome. You also need to solve this question
without taking any help from Java String API.

Number Palindrome
-----------------

A number is said to be a palindrome if number itself is equal to reverse of number e.g. `313` is a palindrome
because reverse of this number is also `313`. On the other hand `123` is not a palindrome because reverse of `123` is `321`
which is not equal to `123`, i.e. original number.
